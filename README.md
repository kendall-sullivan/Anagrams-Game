# Anagrams-Game
This was my final project for the class Core Concepts in Computer Science (COMP 123).
The project was completed in December of 2022.
A description of the game (with rules) is in the python file containing the game's code.
The txt files are needed to import the valid words for the game.
This project received an A.
